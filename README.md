# Bright Multi-Display

A simple macOS application to boost the brightness of all your displays.

## Use Cases

This application is useful when you need to temporarily increase the brightness of your screen beyond the default maximum. This can be helpful for:

*   **Watching dark videos:** If you're watching a movie or video with dark scenes, this tool can make it easier to see what's happening.
*   **Playing dark games:** Some video games have dark environments that can be difficult to navigate. This tool can help you see better in those situations.
*   **Working in bright environments:** If you're working in a very bright room or outdoors, this tool can help make your screen more visible.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
    cd your-repository-name

    ```bash
    swift build
    ```
3.  **Run the application:**
